create a pod
kubectl create deployment NAME --image=image

check info
kubectl get nodes,services,deployment,replicaset

edit a deployment
kubectl edit deployment NAME

delete a deployment
kubectl delete deployment NAME

basically we use configuration.yaml file for creating pods where all the options are available. after creating yaml we do this operation
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
